\section{Background}

Thanks to \cite{Hamby}, we can do stuff. \citet{Hamby}

\section{Data Source}

\section{Methodology}

We first need to remove the global structure of the bullet land.

\subsection{Global Structure Removal}

The non-traditional data structure necessitates employing
non-traditional methods to model and remove the global structure. The
data are made up of two competing structures: the LEA data, of which we
would like to model the global structure, and the GEA data, which we
would like to consider as outlying data. Traditional statistical
modeling techniques minimize the least squared vertical distance from
each data point to a fit line; this results in undue influence by GEA
points, which pull any fit lines towards their unusual points.

While bullets are traditionally circular, it is unwise to use a rigidly
quadratic model to fit the global structure. We cannot assume that fired
bullets will retain a neatly circular shape, especially at the level of
detail scans are captured. The significant amount of physical pressure
that acts upon bullets as they are fired through a barrel also can lead
to some warping or slight deformations \emph{(find a citation from JFS
or AFTE about warping/deformation of bullets?)}. Finally, the placement
of the land relative to the plane of reference when a 3D scan is being
captured can vary slightly, meaning that the 2D crosscuts can be
slightly tilted or rotated. This will not translate into a clean
quadratic-shaped(?) crosscut.

To avoid the potential risks arising from using a quadratic linear
model, we instead use a locally weighted regression (LOESS) which fits
linear regression models on small pieces of the data and combines
predictions to result in a non-parametric predicted fit of the data
structure.

However, since LOESS is still rooted in traditional regression
techniques, it is unable to adequately identify and address the
separation between GEA and LEA data structures. To address this, we
implement a robust version of LOESS which iteratively downweights
unusual data points and re-fits a LOESS model to each land. This robust
LOESS is an adapted version of the robust LOESS proposed by
\cite{Cleveland1}.

This model is fit as follows: (add more formulaic language here\ldots{})

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fit a LOESS model (span = 1) to an entire crosscut to predict y using
  values of x.\\
\item
  Obtain predicted values of y from the model fit in step 1.\\
\item
  Calculate residual values using the predicted y values.\\
\item
  Calculate bisquare weights for each residual value using the following
  formula:\\
  \[max(1 - (residual/(6*mar))^2, 0)^2\]
\item
  Assign weights to each data point according to its residual value. If
  the residual value is positive, assign the bisquare downweight. If the
  residual is negative, leave the weight at 1.\\
\item
  Repeat steps 1-5 with updated weights at each iteration for \(k\)
  iterations, with 20 iterations as the default.\\
\item
  After \(k\) iterations of updating the weight vector, fit a LOESS
  model (span = 1) and obtained predicted and residual values.
\end{enumerate}

The subsequent prediction methods for shoulder location are based on the
residuals calculated from the fit to the global structure of each land.
One method uses penalized two-class classification techniques to
classify each data point into ``LEA'' or ``GEA'', while the second uses
Bayesian changepoint analysis to predict the data points at which the
shoulders begin on either side.

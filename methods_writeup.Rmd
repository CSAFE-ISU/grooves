Goal: come up with a description for each of the methods and write them out.  


## Method 1: Rollapply  

**function name**: `get_grooves_rollapply` or `get_grooves(method = "rollapply")`

```{r}

```

## Method 2: Robust Linear Model (4*Median Cutoff)   

## Method 3: Positive Residuals Cutoff  


## Method 4: Median Absolute Deviation Cutoff  

## Method 5: Predicting Groove Sides

# Groove Engraved Area Identification  

Being able to distinguish between data from land engraved areas (LEAs) and groove engraved areas (GEAs) is an important part of data pre-processing for 3D scans of bullet lands. 

The goal of this project is to develop and test methods for automated detection and removal of data from groove engraved areas.
